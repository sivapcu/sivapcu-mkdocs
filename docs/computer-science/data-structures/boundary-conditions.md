Irrespective of the data structure, there are five boundary conditions we need to be conscious while working on them.

1. Zero Elements.
    1. While inserting, what am i gonna do, if the data structure is empty.
    2. While deleting, what am i gonna do, if the data structure is empty.
2. Only One Element.
    1. While inserting, what am i gonna do, if the data structure has only one element.
    2. While deleting, what am i gonna do, if the data structure has only one element.
3. Operations at the beginning.
    1. I should be worried about the `head` pointer while adding to / Removing from the beginning of the data structure.
4. Adding to / Removing from the end of the data structure.
    1. I should be worried about the `tail` pointer while Adding to / Removing from the end of the data structure.
5. Working in the middle of the data structure.
    1. This is the trivial case
