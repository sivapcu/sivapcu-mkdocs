On a broader sense, the data structures can be categorized into two categories

1. Contiguous data structures
    1. These kind of data structures are created with single stretch of memory in the heap. This includes `Arrays`, `Heaps` and `Hash tables`
2. Linked Data structures
    1. These are created with distinct chunks of memory and linked using pointers/references. `Lists`, `Trees` and `Graphs` are few of them.
