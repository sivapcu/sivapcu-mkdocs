## Introduction

The basic data structure in computer science to hold collection of related data is an `Array`. 

### Disadvantages of Arrays

1. In an **unordered array**, _searching is slow_.
2. In an **ordered array**, _insertion is slow_.
3. In both **ordered and unordered arrays**, _deletion is slow_.
4. They are **never the right size**. Once declared the size of an array can't be changed. They are _either too big or too small_ for your dataset.
