Irrespective of the data structure, there are five boundary conditions we need to be conscious while working on them.

1. Empty data structure.
    1. While inserting data, what am i gonna do, if the data structure is empty or if something is already there.
    2. While deleting data, what am i gonna do, if the data structure is empty or if something is already there.
2. Single element in the data structure.
3. Adding to / Removing from the beginning of the data structure.
    1. I should be worried about the `head` pointer.
4. Adding to / Removing from the end of the data structure.
5. Working in the middle of the data structure.
